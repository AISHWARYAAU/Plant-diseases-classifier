# Creating an AI app that detects diseases in plants using Facebook’s deep learning platform: PyTorch

The goal of this project is to detect different plant diseases by looking a picture.

Everything you need to recreate this project is on the jupyter notebook. Everything was coded in Google Colab, because of its GPU. I uploaded the dataset to Google Drive, so you can download it directly. For more details, the notebook includes the instructions to follow.

You can find the requirements in Requirements.txt, but everything is in the notebook, so you can install all by using pip install. I recommend using Google Colab.
 
This project is updated to be compatible with PyTorch 0.4.0
